        "This database is keeps track of customers and their purchases. This is also used to track how many rewards points customers have which they can use to get free things. Several of the tables here will be updated in real time. Most importantly, it is essential that the rewards points balance is up to date so someone can't just reuse the same rewards points several times before the system updates. This means table 1 will have to update point values in real time when someone makes a purchase. Tables 2 and 3 will be more or less consistent, with occasional changes or additions. Tables 4 and 5 will also have to update in real time in conjunction with table 1. Together, this system will allow customers to easily track their rewards points as well as their purchase history without having to keep receipts. They can also check how many more points they need for a reward and easily see how they can get those points. There is only 1 of table 1, as this table tracks all customers together. There is also only 1 copy of tables 2 and 3. Tables 4 and 5 will each have many distinct tables. There will be a different table 4 for each customer to track purchases separetly without having to sort through other people's orders. There will be a distinct copy of table 5 for each entry in table 4, since each transaction for each customer will need all the details tracked in table 5. There is a 1:M relationship from table 1 to table 4, and a M:M relationship between tables 4 and 5. Tables 2 and 3 are not linked to the others, but they are still necessary for reference, and are still used by the other tables when doing point calculations. For this purpose, tables 2 and 3 have a 1:M relationship with tables 4 and 5 and a 1:1 relationship with table 1.\n",
        "On a typical day, cashiers will use the register and everything will automatically update in the database. Corporate may occasionally change rewards prices and people may get bonuses for other reasons, but most work should be automatic.\n",
        "One constraint we will have is no negative point balances anywhere. Numbers will have to be numbers and phone numbers must have the correct number of digits unless otherwise approved. The system will also ask for confirmation for purchases over $100.\n",
        "The ultimate goal is to make it so customers enjoy our reward system more than our competitors' systems since it is easier to use and more transparent, so they will shop here more."

        "\tThe main focus of this idea is to create a database that stores and analyzes key statistical data of NFL teams and players, to be later analyzed by the front offices of these NFL teams. This is to help show the value of certain players, and overall production to help teams decide who they want on their team, and how much they should pay each individual player. It can also be used as a big picture tool to help teams project their overall performance. I will be focussed on comparing Pre-Season statistics of NFL teams and players, and then comparing that to their current performance during the actual season. The Pre-Season statistics are all completed variables, therefore they will not need to be updated ever. The regular season statistics that are incorporated in the project will all be dynamic and must be updated as the current NFL season progresses. The reason why the Pre-Season statistics are useful is because they can be used to model other players projected statistics on the season, after we find the correlation between the pre-season and the regular season. Front offices around the league have teams dedicated to analyzing these clusters of data, so this idea is nothing new, but still extremely useful. Statisticians and data analyzers use these statistics to help find values in players at position the team needs to upgrade, and these workers will also create a price value that is reported to the general managers as a suggestion for what these players should make if it is decided that their contract be picked up. \n",

        "My idea here is to find the best players that can make my team better. I am trying to think as a general manager for the franchise, whose goal is to make the team win a championship. The idea here is unique as in that there are various ways to look at players and value them. For example of this case in baseball, there is a way to value players looking at only their batting average. There may be another way to evaluate them by looking at the number of homeruns hit. Another way to value them may be based on their stolen bases. This is a modified business; many baseball businesses nowadays find their own ways of valuing players and create their lineup. However, although the basic outline may be modified, we are trying to be unique. Therefore, we will look at what not many businesses look at when creating their team. We will look at the player’s defensive statistics to create our team’s lineup. We will look at their fielding percentage, error, assist, putouts and the baseball team Los Angeles Angels’ 2019 player data. By creating a company (in this case a team) that looks at defensive statistics extensively rather than all other teams which only look at offensive statistics such as batting average or homerun, our interaction ( in this case our team) would have players that may not have the hottest bat, but have the best gloves and arm in the league. We as a team will have fun highlights to watch every night with spectacular defensive plays. As a front office person, I will try to find better defensive players; maybe someone who can bat well too at the same time.\n"
